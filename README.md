## üí≠ Words to Code By

_You shipped but have you looked inside the codebase?
Have you pondered the whimsical nature of the code you are about to refactor?
The many mistakes leaving the fingertips of every software engineer who didn't care about the performance or architecture - 
just close the ticket; nobody will care, nobody has ownership, others will handle it when it fails
and it will fail, it will be other people's problem_
